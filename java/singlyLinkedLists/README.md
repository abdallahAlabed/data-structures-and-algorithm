# Singly Linked Lists
### A LinkedList class and Node class. The LinkedList keeps track of what node is its head value, and each node contains its own value and a pointer to the node after it in the list.

## Challenge
### Create Node class and linked list class, and create (insert, include, to strin) methods inside linked list class.

## Approach & Efficiency

### * Time: O(n)
### * Space: O(1)

## API

### * insert Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

### * includes Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

### * to string Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> {
